Overview   {{{1~
                                                 *voof-overview*
VOOF (Vim Outliner Of Folds) is a plugin for Vim that emulates a two-pane text
outliner. It can be used with any file or buffer that has start fold markers
with level numbers (|fold-marker|) such as this help file.

Screenshots and an animation: http://www.flickr.com/photos/voof/

The are four main Ex commands: Voof, Voofhelp, Voofrun, Vooflog.

:Voof       Creates outline of the current buffer. The outline is constructed
            from lines with start fold markers with level numbers, which
            become headlines. The outline is displayed in a scratch buffer, in
            a separate window, which emulates tree pane of a two-pane
            outliner. Such buffers are referred to as Tree buffers. The
            current buffer becomes a Body buffer. Each Tree headline is
            associated with a region (fold) of the corresponding Body, called
            node. Nodes can be navigated by browsing the Tree. They can also
            be manipulated from the Tree: moved up/down, promoted/demoted,
            marked/unmarked, etc.
            See OUTLINING (|Voof|) for detailed user guide.

:Voofhelp   Opens help file voof.txt as outline in a new tabpage.


The VOOF plugin also provides two utilities useful when working with Vim and
Python scripts. They can be used independently of the outlining functionality
provided by the :Voof command. These two utilities emulate corresponding
features of Leo text outliner.

:Voofrun    Executes text in the current node or fold as Vim script or Python
            script. This is useful for testing code snippets and for
            organizing scripts by segregating them into folds. This command
            does not require an outline to be created and can be used with any
            buffer that has folds.
            See RUNNING SCRIPTS (|Voofrun|) for details.

:Vooflog    Creates scratch buffer __PyLog__ and redirects Python stdout and
            stderr to that buffer. This feature is not related to folding or
            outlining and is completely independent from the rest of the
            plugin. It's useful when scripting Vim with Python.
            See __PyLog__ BUFFER (|Vooflog|) for details.

QUICK DEMO (no installation needed):~
Make sure files voof.vim and voof.py are together in one folder.
Open voof.vim and do >
    :so %
    :Voof
This will create Tree buffer for voof.vim .

<Up>, <Left>, <Up>, <Down> arrow keys move around the Tree and select new node
(all mappings are for the normal mode).

<Return> selects node the cursor is on and then cycles between Tree and
voof.vim . So, to select another node, move to it with h, j, etc. and hit
Return.

<Tab> cycles between Tree and voof.vim windows without selecting node.

(All VOOF mappings, except Return and Tab, are for Tree buffers only.)

<Space> expands/contracts node without selecting it. Standard Vim folding
command (zo, zc, zR, zM, etc.) can be used as well.

Left mouse click in the Tree selects node. If the click is to the left/right
of headline text, the node's expanded/contracted status is toggled.

Edit a headline (line with a fold marker) in voof.vim and go back into the
Tree: the outline will be updated.

<C-Up>, <C-Down> move node or a range of sibling nodes up/down.
<C-Left>, <C-Right> promote/demote.

Folder "sample_outlines" contains some outlines to experiment with.
File "calendar_outline.txt" is a rather large outline for stress-testing
purposes: 3.1MB, 56527 lines, 4160 headlines.

To try Python Log Buffer feature: >
    :Vooflog
    :py assert 2==3
    :py print VOOF.nodes
    :py print u'\u2248 \u2260'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limitations   {{{2~
VOOF is not scalable to large outlines. Nodes are not true object, they are
just line numbers of Body headlines. The bottleneck is the brute force update
of the outline data (performed by voof.treeUpdate()). Such update, which
basically recreates outline from scratch, must be done whenever the user
switches to Tree buffer after modifying corresponding Body--we can't possibly
know what the user did with the Body while he was away from the Tree.

Sample outline "calendar_outline.txt" seems to be approaching the usable size
limit on my 2002 notebook (1.6GHz Pentium 4 Mobile):
    3.2MB, 56527 lines, 4160 headlines.
When moving to Tree after modifying Body, the pause due to outline update is
noticeable but is still less than a second.

Browsing outline is fast regardless of it's size. Outline operations are also
fast because they bypass global outline update unless "g:voof_verify_oop" is
set to 1.

In case of "calendar_outline.txt" stress test, the time consuming step is not
just scanning for fold markers, but also comparing >4000 headlines between the
two outlines (old and new) or, if outlines are very different, setting all
lines in the Tree buffer. This means that outlines can be larger if they have
much fewer headlines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other Text Outliners  {{{2~

Leo:
    http://webpages.charter.net/edreamleo/front.html
    The __PyLog__ buffer, which is created by command :Vooflog, is the
    equivalent of Leo's log pane.
    The :Voofrun command is like Leo's Execute Script command when performed
    on a node which has an @others directive.
    Mark/Unmark nodes operations are modeled after identical Leo's commands.

The "Tag List" Vim plugin:
    http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=273
    Conceptually VOOF is similar to the Taglist plugin. Taglist uses the ctags
    program to scan file for lines with tags. VOOF uses Python script to scan
    buffer for lines with start fold markers with levels.

==============================================================================
Requirements   {{{1~
                                                 *voof-requirements*
VOOF uses Python and requires Python-enabled Vim 7.x, that is Vim compiled
with the Python interface. Your Vim is Python-enabled if it can do >
    :py print 2**0.5

Python version should be 2.4 - 2.6 .
Python 3 is not supported and is not compatible with Vim anyway.

Vim version 7.2 or above is preferred. Version 7.1 should also work.
Version 7.0 might work as well but has not been tested.

Vim should be compiled using normal or bigger feature set.

Vim patch 7.2.161 is required in order to be able to work on the same outline
(or any buffer with folds) in separate tabpages.

==============================================================================
Installation   {{{1~
                                                 *voof-install*
Copy files "voof.vim" and "voof.py" to your local plugin folder:
  $HOME/vimfiles/plugin (Windows)
          ~/.vim/plugin (Unix)
This will make commands Voof, Vooflog, Voofrun available from any buffer.

Copy help file "voof.txt" to your local doc folder. (It can also be in the
same folder as voof.vim.) Command Voofhelp opens voof.txt as outline in a new
tabpage.

Optional: to generate help tags (there are few), do ':helptags <doc dir>' (see
|add-local-help|).

To try VOOF without installing anything:
Make sure voof.vim, voof.py, voof.txt are in the same directory.
Open voof.vim and do >
    :so %
    :Voof
To create outline for another file, run :Voof command for it: >
    :tabnew
    :e $VIMRUNTIME/autoload/netrw.vim
    :Voof

NOTE: VOOF uses quickload mechanism, see |write-plugin-quickload|. The bulk of
the "voof.vim" script is sourced and "voof.py" is imported only after a Voof
command is run for the first time.

NOTE: When "voof.vim" is sourced, its Python code adds script's directory to
sys.path and then imports "voof.py". This creates file "voof.pyc". Command
:Voofrun, when running Python script, creates file "voofScript.py" also in the
"voof.vim" directory.

==============================================================================
Options   {{{1~
                                                 *voof-options*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vim Options   {{{2~

'foldmethod' for the buffer for which the :Voof command is run should
naturally be 'marker' (:set fdm=marker). This, however, is not required to
create an outline or to use it. Outline operations do not rely on Vim folds,
they use fold markers with levels. Other fold options, such as 'foldtext'
could be set according to personal preferences and could be filetype-specific.

'foldmarker' (local to window) is used by the Voof command to obtain the start
fold marker string. There is usually no reason to change this option from
default.

<LocalLeader> is used to start many outline operations while in a Tree buffer.
By default, it's backslash. For example, \i inserts new node.  To change it to
another character, assign maplocalleader in .vimrc: >
     let maplocalleader=','

'scrolloff' should be 0 (default) or a small number (1 or 2). This global
option affects how the headline is positioned in the Body window after
selecting node in the Tree. For example, with scrolloff=1, the headline will
be on the 2nd window line in the Body window. A very large value can be
confusing when switching between Tree and Body windows.

Vim commands for creating and deleting folds are not very useful and are
potentially dangerous when typed accidentally. They can be disabled in .vimrc
as follows: >
     " Disable commands for creating and deleting folds.
     noremap zf <Nop>
     noremap zF <Nop>
     noremap zd <Nop>
     noremap zD <Nop>
     noremap zE <Nop>

Some color schemes (including default) use the same or similar background
colors for Visual, Folded and CursorLine highlight groups. These highlight
groups are used in Tree windows and it's better if they are different from
each other.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VOOF Options   {{{2~
These are VOOF-specific global variables that can be assigned in .vimrc.
Example: >
    let g:voof_tree_placement = "left"
    let g:voof_tree_width = 40

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Window options   {{{3~

g:voof_tree_placement   ~
    Where Tree window is created: "left", "right", "top", "bottom"
    This is relative to the current window.
    Default: "left"

g:voof_tree_width   ~
    Initial Tree window width.
    Default: 30

g:voof_tree_hight   ~
    Initial Tree window hight.
    Default: 12

g:voof_log_placement   ~
    Where Log window is created: "left", "right", "top", "bottom"
    This is far left/right/top/bottom.
    Default: "bottom"

g:voof_log_width   ~
    Initial Log window width.
    Default: 30

g:voof_log_hight   ~
    Initial Log window hight.
    Default: 12

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tree/Body shuttle keys   {{{3~

Since VOOF emulates a two-pane outliner, it's important to have keys that
shuttle between the two panes. By default, such keys are <Return> (Select Node
and Shuttle between Body and Tree) and <Tab> (Shuttle between Body and Tree).
These keys are mapped for Normal mode, both in Tree and Body buffers. By
default, these two keys do not do anything useful in Normal mode. However,
plugins and user scripts might use them. The next two settings allow to use
keys other than <Return> or <Tab>. Note also, that these are the only keys
that get mapped in Body when the Voof command is run.

g:voof_return_key   ~
    Key for selecting node and shuttling between Tree and Body windows.
    It will be used in Normal mode, buffer-local mappings in Trees and Bodies.
    Default: "<Return>"
g:voof_tab_key   ~
    Key for shuttling between Tree and Body windows without selecting node.
    It will be used in Normal mode, buffer-local mappings in Trees and Bodies.
    Default: "<Tab>"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other options   {{{3~

g:voof_verify_oop   ~
    Verify outline after outline operations.
    Default is 0 (disabled).
    Set to 1 (enable) if a bug in an outline operation is suspected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customizing Tree and __PyLog__ buffers   {{{3~

When a Tree buffer is created, its 'filetype' is set to "vooftree"
When __PyLog__ buffer is created, its 'filetype' is set to "log".

This should allow user customization of these buffers (syntax, wrap/norwap,
list/nolist, etc.) via standard Vim configuration files:
   $HOME/vimfiles/ftplugin/vooftree.vim
   $HOME/vimfiles/syntax/vooftree.vim
   $HOME/vimfiles/after/syntax/log.vim
   etc.

==============================================================================
OUTLINING (:Voof)   {{{1~
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create Outline   {{{2~
                                                 *Voof*
:Voof   This command creates outline of the current buffer and displays it in
        a new window in a scratch buffer called Tree buffer. The current
        buffer becomes a Body buffer. The following happens:

The current buffer (Body) is scanned for lines with start fold markers with
level numbers: {{{3, {{{1, etc. End fold markers }}}1, }}}3, etc. are ignored
and should not be used. These lines, or headlines, are displayed in the
corresponding Tree buffer as an outline using an indent-based folding.  The
level of each headline is set to the number after the fold marker.

NOTE: Matching fold markers without level numbers, {{{ and }}}, are ignored
and are useful to fold small areas inside numbered folds, e.g. parts of
functions. The region between {{{ and }}} should not contain fold markers with
levels.

Tree buffers are named {bufname}_VOOF{bufnr} where {bufname} and {bufnr} are
buffer name and number of the corresponding Body buffer.

Tree buffers are displayed in separate windows. A Tree buffer and its window
are configured to behave as tree pane of a two-pane outliner. Each headline in
Tree buffer is associated with a node in the corresponding Body.

"Node" is a Body buffer range that begins with headline (line with start fold
marker with level number) and ends before the next headline. The last node
ends with the last buffer line. The region from start of buffer to the first
headline (or end of buffer) is treated as a special node number 1 (it can have
zero lines).

When a Body has 'foldmethod' set to 'marker', Body nodes are also folds. This
is recommended, but is not required: VOOF does not rely on folding, only on
lines with start fold markers with levels.

Selecting a headline in the Tree (<Return>, <Up>, <Down>, <Left>, <Right>)
will display corresponding node in Body window. Nodes can be manipulated
from the Tree buffer: deleted, moved, promoted, demoted, marked, etc. Of
course, the Body can be edited directly as any other buffer with folds.

The outline data and the Tree buffer are updated as needed every time the
cursor is moved to Tree window (on BufEnter). The actual update happens if the
Body has been modified since the last update (when Body's 'changedtick' is
different). This update is the bottleneck that limits the size of outlines
that can be worked with comfortably.

A Tree buffer is not modifiable and should never be edited directly. It has
many buffer-local mappings that are designed to navigate the outline (e.g.,
<Space> expands or contacts node), and to perform outline operations, that is
to manipulate nodes in the corresponding Body (e.g., <C-Up> moves node and its
tree up).

A Body buffer has only two buffer-local mappings: <Return> and <Tab> in Normal
mode. They select current node or move cursor to window with the corresponding
Tree buffer. Other keys can be used instead of Return and Tab by assigning
g:voof_return_key and g:voof_tab_key Vim global variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About Fold Markers   {{{3~
Voof command does not create an outline of folds. It creates an outline of
start fold markers with level numbers. For best resutls, the Body should have
'foldmethod' set to 'marker'. Then nodes in the Tree buffer will also
represent Body folds.

The start fold marker is obtained from option 'foldmarker' (local to window)
when Tree buffer is created with the Voof command. For example, after >
    :set foldmarker=<<<,>>>
    :Voof
VOOF will create outline from lines with <<<1, <<<2, <<<3, etc.

VOOF scans only for start fold markers with level numbers. Fold markers
without level numbers and any end fold markers are ignored. This is not a
problem as long as the user follows the following rules. Based on the author's
experience, these rules are very reasonable. They are similar to
recommendations given in Vim help (:help fold-marker).

1) Use start fold markers with levels, <<<1, <<<2, etc to start new fold/node.
These should correspond to important structures: parts and chapters in a book,
functions and classes in a code.

2) DO NOT USE END FOLD MARKERS WITH LEVELS: >>>1, >>>2, etc. This is a
reasonable requirement: it's hard to keep track of end fold markers in a large
outline and they are redundant anyway.

3) Do use pairs of matching fold markers without level, <<< and >>>, to fold
small areas of text (a screenful), such as parts of functions. Just make sure
the area doesn't contain fold markers with levels.


Files that have end fold markers with levels are ok for browsing with VOOF,
but outline operations will most definitely produce unintended results.
Consider the following structure: >
    node 0
        node 1   <<<1
            node 1.1 <<<2
        >>>1
    ? ? ? ?
    ? ? ? ?
        node 2   <<<1
        node 3   <<<1
Lines with ? are not part of any fold. But VOOF considers them part of
node 1.1 and will move them accordingly when that node is moved.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
~~~===--- Tree Headline Text ---===~~~  "#//% /*{{{3*/ ~
The headline text as displayed in Tree buffer is constructed from the
corresponding Body headline as follows:

Part of the Body headline before the first matching fold marker is taken.
Trailing white space and line comment chars #"/*% are removed.
Leading and trailing white space is removed.
Leading and trailing filler chars -=~ are removed.
White space is trimmed again.

This is done by voofOutline() in voof.py .

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selected Node   {{{3~
At any moment, one node is designated as selected. It is marked by = character
in the Tree buffer. This is similar to current position in a true two-pane
outliner.

A node is selected by pressing <Return> (Normal mode, both Tree and Body), or
by selecting new node in Tree window with arrow keys or mouse left button
click.

It is possible to save position of selected node between sessions:
Insert '=' in the Body headline right after the level number, or if the node
is marked, after the 'x' character. Next time, when the outline is created
with the Voof command, this node will be automatically selected. It is better,
however, to add '=' char with  <LocalLeader>=  command in the Tree: it will
make sure that all other = marks are removed from Body headlines.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Delete Outline   {{{3~
To delete VOOF outline for a particular Body buffer: unload, delete, or wipe
out the corresponding Tree buffer. Tree buffers are configured to be wiped out
when deleted or unloaded.

When a Tree is wiped out, the associated Body buffer becomes as it was before
the outline creation: it looses buffer-local mappings and autocommands created
by VOOF. Outline data associated with this Body buffer (Vim and Python
dictionary items) are deleted.

When a Body buffer is unloaded, deleted or wiped out, the corresponding Tree
buffer is wiped out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outline Navigation   {{{2~
The following mappings are for Normal mode.

<Return> In Body buffer: select current node and show it in Tree window.
         If current node is already selected, move cursor to Tree window.
         In Tree buffer: select current node and show it in Body window.
         If current node is already selected, move cursor to Body window.

         Note: <Return> creates new window with Body or Tree in the current
         tabpage if there is none. Thus, hitting <Return> after "tab split"
         will create tabpage with a new outline view.

<Tab>    In Body buffer or Tree buffer: move cursor to next window with the
         corresponding Body or Tree buffer.

Note: <Return> and <Tab> are the only keys mapped by Voof in Bodies. Other
keys can be used instead by defining g:voof_return_key and g:voof_tab_key.
All other mappings are for Tree buffers only.

<Up>      Move cursor Up and select new node.

<Down>    Move cursor Down and select new node.

<Right>   Traverse node's tree down: move to first child and select it

<Left>    Traverse node's tree up: move to parent and select it.
          If the node is expanded, it will be contracted first.

=         Put cursor on selected node.

<LeftRelease> Mouse left button click. If the click is to the right or to the
              left of the headline text, select node and toggle its
              expanded/contracted state. If the click is on the headline text,
              just select node.

<Space>   Toggle node's expanded/contracted state without selecting it. Make
          node visible if it's hidden in a fold.

NOTE: Standard Vim folding commands can be used to expand/contract nodes
while in Tree: zc, zo, zM, zR, etc.

x         Go to next marked node (find headline marked with 'x').
X         Go to previous marked node.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outline Operations   {{{2~
Outline operations are performed using Tree buffer-local mappings.

When appropriate, operations are automatically applied to trees, that is to
Body nodes and their subnodes. E.g., moving a node, moves the node and its
children as a tree.

When nodes are moved, inserted, etc., their level numbers and those of their
subnodes are automatically adjusted according to their new position in the
outline.

The entire operation can be undone with one undo command in the corresponding
Body buffer.

Most operations can be performed on a range of sibling nodes using Visual
mode. The range is checked for being a valid range: all top level nodes should
be at the same level.

Where the  moved or inserted nodes end up depends on the expanded/contracted
status of the node after which the nodes are inserted. This should be
intuitive and replicates default behavior of Leo text outliner.

Outline operation, with the exception of Copy, are disabled if the Body buffer
is 'nomodifiable' or 'readonly'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edit Headline   {{{3~
The only way to edit headline text is to edit corresponding Body line.

While in a Tree buffer, Normal mode:

i I a A    Start editing headline the cursor is on.
           The cursor is moved into a Body window and placed on the first word
           char of the headline.

Other common commands for changing text are disabled while in a Tree.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert New Node   {{{3~

<LocalLeader>i   Insert new node after current node.
<LocalLeader>I   Insert new node as child of current node.

This command creates new headline and puts cursor on the new headline in the
Body where it can be edited. Tree buffer, Normal mode only.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Move/Copy/Cut/Paste Nodes   {{{3~

<C-Up>
<LocalLeader>u      Move node(s) up.

<C-Down>
<LocalLeader>d      Move node(s) down.

<C-Left>
<<
<LocalLeader>l      Move node(s) left (promote).

<C-Right>
>>
<LocalLeader>r      Move node(s) right (demote).

dd                  Cut node(s).

yy                  Copy node(s).

pp                  Paste node(s) after current node.

With the exception of Paste, these Tree buffer mappings are available in
Normal and Visual modes. They apply to trees, not nodes. In Visual mode, the
range is checked for being valid: top level nodes in the range must be
siblings.

Cut/Copy/Paste commands use Vim's + register, that is system clipboard. The
Paste command checks clipboard for being a valid Voof outline or a range of
sibling outlines. The first line in the clipboard must have fold marker with
level number.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark/Unmark Nodes   {{{3~

A node is marked/unmarked by adding/removing 'x' in Body headline after start
fold marker level number. Marked nodes have 'x' in their Tree headlines.

<LocalLeader>m   Mark node the cursor is on (Normal mode) or all nodes in
                 the range (Visual). "x" is added after Body headline level
                 number.

<LocalLeader>M   Unmark node(s). "x" after Body headline level number is
                 removed.

These commands apply to nodes, not trees.

To unmark all: ggVG<LocalLeader>M

'x' and 'X' (Normal mode) move to next or previous marked node.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mark Node as Selected Node   {{{3~

<LocalLeader>=   Mark node the cursor is on as to be selected after startup.
                 Tree buffer, Normal mode only.

This command puts '=' char in Body headline after the level number or, if the
node is marked, after 'x'. All other '=' marks are removed. This mark only
affects Voof startup: the marked node becomes selected node when the outline
is created with the Voof command.


==============================================================================
RUNNING SCRIPTS (:Voofrun)   {{{1~
                                                 *Voofrun*
Command :Voofr(un) executes text in the current fold or node.
In Tree buffers, this command is also mapped to <LocalLeader>r .

The following happens:
---------------------
1) The type of script is determined.

:Voofrun
    Without an argument, the type of script is set to the buffer 'filetype':
    "python" if filetype is "python", "vim" if filetype is "vim", etc. When
    run from a Tree (also with <LocalLeader>r), filetype of the corresponding
    Body is used.

:Voofrun vim
    Run as "vim" script.

:Voofrun py
    Run as "python" script.

:Voofrun whatever
    Run as "whatever" script.

If script is neither "vim" nor "python", the command aborts.
(It should be possible to add support for other script types.)

---------------------
2) When run from a regular, not-Tree buffer, the script text is set to that of
the current fold, including all subfolds. This obviously makes sense only if
'foldmethod' is 'marker'.

---------------------
3) When run from a Tree buffer, the script text is set to that of the current
Body node (including headline) and all descendant nodes. The actual folding in
the corresponding Body does not matter and fold markers without levels are
ignored.

---------------------
4) Vim script is executed by copying text into a register and executing that
register inside try/catch/endtry block.

---------------------
5) Python script is executed by first writing text to file "vooScript.py" in the
"voof.vim" directory. The file is then executed using execfile() inside
try/except block. ( http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#execfile )
The following Python names are predefined: vim, VOOF, voof.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#=============================================================================
Known Problems   {{{2~

1) Vim script code executed this way cannot use |line-continuation|.


2) When Voofrun executes a Vim script with Python code and a Python error
occurs, Python traceback is not printed. However, Python traceback is printed
to the PyLog buffer if it is enabled. Example in the next fold can be run with
":Voofr vim". >

    " Vim script with Python error {{{
    echo 'start of vim script'
    py print bogus_name
    py print 'py after error'
    echo 'the end'
    " }}}

Also, Vim script is not terminated when an error occurs in Python code.

==============================================================================
__PyLog__ BUFFER (:Vooflog)   {{{1~
                                                 *Vooflog*
:Vooflog   This command creates scratch buffer __PyLog__ and redirects
           Python stdout and stderr to that buffer.

Subsequent Python print statements and error messages are appended to the
__PyLog__ buffer instead of being printed on Vim command line.

Log windows in all tabpages are scrolled automatically when something is
printed to the Log buffer. If a tabpage has several Log windows, only the
first one is scrolled. If the current tabpage has no Log windows, the Vooflog
command can be used to create one.

To restore original stdout and stdin (that is Vim command line):
unload, delete, or wipeout the __PyLog__ buffer.
NOTE: the __PyLog__ buffer is configured to be wiped out when unloaded or
deleted.

The filetype of the Log buffer is set to "log". Some syntax highlighting is
added automatically to highlight Python error messages and common Voof
messages.

When Python attemps to print a unicode string, e.g. >
    :py print u'ascii test'
    :py print u'\u042D \u042E \u042F \u2248 \u2260'
the string is encoded using the value of Vim option 'encoding' at the time
when the __PyLog__ buffer was created.


Known Problems:   {{{2~
1) __PyLog__ is not usable when in the Ex mode, that is after 'Q' or 'gQ'.
The lines in the __PyLog__ buffer will appear after the Ex mode is exited.

2) Under some conditions, there is a problem with the output of help(), which
apparently uses pydoc.py, which does something strange to output trailing \n.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open new instance of Vim.
2. Vooflog
3. :py help(help)
4. Delete __PyLog__ buffer.
5. :py help(help)
An error occurs: '\n' is printed to the nonexisting log buffer.

Why VOOF uses Python   {{{2~
Python scans buffer for fold markers 7-15 times faster than an equivalent Vim
script code. A demo code is given below. To test: do block selection, copy it
into a register, execute that register, then run command 'Vooftemp' on any
buffer with a large number of folds, or on any large buffer.

Also, Vim's FOR loop is about 30 times slower then Python's: >

    func! Time_VimForLoop()
        let aList = range(1000000)
        let start = reltime()
        for i in aList
            "do nothing
        endfor
        echo 'Vim:    ' . reltimestr(reltime(start))
    endfunc

    func! Time_PyForLoop()
        let start = reltime()
        py aList = range(1000000)
        py for i in aList: pass
        echo 'Python: ' . reltimestr(reltime(start))
    endfunc

    call Time_VimForLoop()  " 8.7 sec
    call Time_PyForLoop()   " 0.3 sec

Thus, Python code should be much faster when handling large lists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Separate Trees or Single Tree   {{{2~
A single Tree buffer could be used to display outlines of many files. Tlist
does that. This makes sense when working with several related files. Also,
having a single Tree would be more like Leo.

VOOF creates new Tree buffer for every new outline. This is simpler. It is
more appropriate for text notes, when outline files are likely to be
unrelated. Searching headlines is easier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When to wipe out Tree buffer   {{{2~
A Tree buffer should be wiped out and the corresponding VOOF data deleted
immediately after:

1) Tree is unloaded. All content is lost, Tree reverts to blank buffer.
2) Tree is deleted. As above, plus buffer local mappings are lost.
3) Body is unloaded. The following scenario will cause outline corruption:
user is in Tree, he does :bunload! on corresponding Body, which is modified,
and then performs outline operation.
4) Body is deleted. Buffer-local autocommands and mappings are lost.
5) Body is wiped out. Tree has no reason to exist.

This is accomplished via BufUnload autocommands for Tree and Body.
BufUnload is also triggered on BufDelete and BufWipeout.

CHANGELOG   {{{2~

v1.4, 2009-07-12   {{{3x~
New Tree navigation commands (Normal mode):
 x   Go to next marked node (mnemonics: find headline marked with 'x').
 X   Go to previous marked node.

"Unmark Node" operation now removes all consecutive 'x' chars from Body
headline instead of just one. This eliminates confusion when a bunch of 'x' is
present after start fold marker level number. For the same reason, "Mark Node
as Selected" (<LocalLeader>=) now strips 'x' chars after removed '=' char.

Bug: When Body starts with a headline, click on the first line in Tree (path
info line) doesn't select first node.
Fix: in Python code of Voof_TreeSelect() replaced
 nodeEnd =  VOOF.nodes[body][lnum]-1
   with
 nodeEnd =  VOOF.nodes[body][lnum]-1 or 1

Fixed errors in LogBufferClass write() method, printing messages when log
buffer doesn't exist.

Bug: Select more than one lines in Tree and press i/I/A/a. An error in
Voof_OopEdit() occurs.
Fix: Mapped i/I/A/a keys only for Normal mode with nnoremap. They were
mistakenly mapped with noremap.

A message is now printed when an outline operation is aborted because Body
buffer is readonly or nomodifiable.

Replaced most Python regions in voof.vim with voof.py functions.

Renamed some Python functions:
voof_WhatEver() means it's Python code for Voof_WhatEver() Vim function.

Voof_FoldLines() renamed Voof_GetLines().
Voof_FoldRun() renamed Voof_Run().

Various edits and additions in voof.txt.


v1.3, 2009-06-06   {{{3~
New: start fold marker string is obtained from Vim option 'foldmarker' when
the Voof command is run. Each Body buffer can have its own start fold marker.

Replaced Body's BufDelete autocommand with BufUnload autocommand. Tree buffer
is now wiped out when its Body is unloaded, deleted or wiped out. Corrected
Body and Tree BufUnload au functions: use "nested" and "noautocmd".

Added * to chars being stripped during headline construction to allow /**/
around fold markers. Better syntax highlight for commented headlines in Tree.

Changed how Tree buffer name is constructed: {bufname}_VOOF{bufnr} instead of
VOOF_{bufname}_{bufnr}.

When checking if current buffer is a Tree, instead of checking buffer name, do
has_key(g:voof_trees, bufnr('')).

When eventignore is set, save and restore original eventignore instead of
doing "set eventignore=" .

Annoyance: Moving Tree window to top/bottom (^W K/J) maximizes window height.
Fix: Don't set "winfixheight" when creating Tree window. I don't understand why
this happens. There is no such problem with "winfixwidth".

Got rid of Voof_ErrorMsg() and Voof_InfoMsg().

Expanded help file.

v1.2, 2009-05-30   {{{3~
Bug: after outline operation cursor may be on the last line of range instead
of first (if Visual and there is only one root node).
Fix: tweaked Voof_OopShowTree().

Re-wrote Voof_TreeToggleFold() to handle: no fold at cursor; cursor hidden in
fold.

Allow outline operation Copy when Body is noma or ro.

v1.1, 2009-05-26   {{{3~
Bug fix involving nomodifiable and readonly buffers.
Outline operations now silently abort if Body is noma or ro.

v1.0, 2009-05-25   {{{3~
